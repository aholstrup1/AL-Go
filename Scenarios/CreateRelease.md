1. Choose the release (1.0) and you will see the release. The release notes are pulled from all pull-requests checked in since the last release. The auto-generated release note also contains a list of the new contributers and a link to the full changelog. Choose the **Edit** button (the pencil) to modify the release notes. At the bottom, you can see the artifacts published, both the apps and the source code. A tag is created in the repository for the release number to always keep this.

1. Under **Actions**, select the **CI/CD** workflow and choose **Run workflow** to kick off a new CI/CD workflow. After the CI/CD workflow finishes, you can inspect the workflow output to see that the latest release was used as a baseline for the upgrade tests in the pipeline. You will also see that the new build, just created was deployed to the QA environment automatically.
