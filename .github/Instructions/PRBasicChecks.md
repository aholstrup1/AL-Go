# Basic Rules for Code Reviews
### All changes should have release notes
All Pull Requests into the repository should have release notes added to the `RELEASENOTES.md` file. Release notes typically reference an Issue ID or Discussion ID but that is not required. If a PR is missing a release note, please suggest it and prefix it with (Copilot).
