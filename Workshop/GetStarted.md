# Get Started

With our prerequisites in place, it is time to get started and create our first repository.

In a browser, navigate to https://aka.ms/algopte:

Note the warnings explaining that no apps have been added. The CI/CD workflow doesn't have anything to compile yet as you didn't add any source code.

Ignore the warning about available updates for now.

After this step, we are done setting up a basic AL-Go for GitHub repository and we only need to add our apps.

So, let's add an app...
