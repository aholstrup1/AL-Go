# Performance Testing

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is under development. For now, refer to the [Add a performance test app to an existing project](../Scenarios/AddAPerformanceTestApp.md) scenario for guidance on setting up performance testing.

Testing is an important part of app quality, and AL-Go for GitHub includes support for Business Central Performance Toolkit (BCPT) tests to ensure your apps perform well.

## Key Concepts

- **BCPT Tests**: Automated performance tests that measure application performance under load
- **Performance Thresholds**: Configurable limits for test duration and SQL statement counts
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular performance validation as part of your CI/CD pipeline

For detailed setup instructions, see:
- [Add a performance test app to an existing project](../Scenarios/AddAPerformanceTestApp.md)
- [Settings Reference - bcptTestFolders](../Scenarios/settings.md#bcptTestFolders)
- [Settings Reference - bcptThresholds](../Scenarios/settings.md#bcptThresholds)
